        Setup
    </p>
    <p class='clear darkest'>
    	The size of the field should be adjusted to the number of players you have.  Fewer players = smaller field.  Use your cones/markers to create the sidelines.  The length and width is up to the players, but for a 6-a-side game, 
        the field should be slightly larger than a basketball court, so about 60 ft wide and 120 feet long.
