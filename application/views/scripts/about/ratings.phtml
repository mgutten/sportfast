	How to read your ratings
</header>

<p class='clear darkest indent margin-top' >
	In each sport, users rate you based on 3 categories: <span class='green heavy'>skill, sportsmanship, and attendance</span>.
    These three categories are averaged out (based on a calculated weighting scale) to give us your <span class='green heavy'>overall</span> rating. 
    This overall rating is the number you will see most prominently as it is the most accurate value of a player's overall abilities and demeanor.
    The result will look something like this:
</p>
<img src='/images/about/ratings/ratings.png' class='clear' id='ratings-img' />

<p class='clear larger-margin-top larger-text heavy darkest'>
	But, I just joined and haven't been rated by other users...?

	Can't sneak anything past you, can we!  In order to get you playing games as quickly as possible, we have a universal conversion from our signup "skill"
    section (i.e. "Beginner", "Decent", "Good", "Better", etc) to a weighted number value.  The same conversion is used when another user rates you.

	Why have ratings at all?
</p>
<p class='clear darkest indent margin-top' style='padding-bottom: .5em'>
	We aren't ones to pick the athletically-challenged kid last for dodgeball, but it is actually very important to separate skilled players from beginners.
    Without a clear line drawn, games become less enjoyable for everyone.  By having ratings, users cannot only see their progress over time, but our system 
    can create even better games for them.
