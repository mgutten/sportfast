				If there aren't, then we will hold off on creating one until there are enough players.  Nothing is worse than showing up
				only to see that there aren't enough people to play a game.  You can <a href='/create/game/' class='medium underline'>create one</a> if

$question = "Why can't I see all of the games in my area from my dashboard?";
$answer   = "The dashboard is designed for quick browsing based on your sport preferences specified under \"Account Settings\".
				The most common reasons you can't see a particular game is because <strong>you are already in it</strong>, <strong>
				your search parameters are set incorrectly</strong>, or <strong>the game is not a good match for you</strong>.
				Change the search parameters next to the \"Find\" section on your dashboard, or try looking under the \"Find\" dropdown in the navigation.";

$question = "How do you determine if a game/team is a good or bad match for me?";
$answer   = "Matching is based on two key factors: <strong>skill</strong> and <strong>age</strong>.
				While there is much more to determining whether a game/team is a good match for you, 
				these are generally good indicators of how competitive the game will be.";

$question = "Why do I need a profile picture?";
$answer   = "If you want to receive ratings, a picture is essential.  Most people are terrible with names (we are), so a picture helps to identify people.
				Pictures also give a personal touch to an otherwise anonymous situation.  Try to choose pictures that are easily recognizable.";

$question = "I can't find any teams.  Should I create one?";
$answer   = "League teams are tricky.  They require a little bit of effort on behalf of the creator/team captain to get together and organize.  You are more than welcome
				to create a team of your own, but if you are relying entirely on our system to locate players, then you are better off waiting.  Like games, our system 
				matches players based on skill, age, and position to create a suitable, competitive team.  Once enough players are found, the team will be 
				created and you will be offered a spot on the team.  When the team comes together, it is time for registration.  Read about leagues <a href='/about/leagues' class='medium underline'>

$question = "Can I create a team and not join a league?";
$answer   = "Sure!  Our team system is purely an organizational tool to help you organize and coordinate groups of people.  It was designed for league teams, but
				there is nothing stopping you from using it in some other fashion.";

$question = "How do I add/edit my team captains?";
$answer   = "Team captains are the managers of your team page.  They can do everything that the creator can (e.g. remove players, edit the schedule, etc).  Under your
				\"Manage\" dropdown on your team's page, you will see \"Team Info\".  The popup that appears will allow you to edit all kinds of information about
				your team, including who is a team captain.";
