Like all hopeful startups, Sportfast was born in a basement.  And I don't mean a figurative basement.  No.  This is a literal basement.  
Not a dusty, poorly-lit room, but a basement nonetheless.  We're a small, and I do mean small, company started in Marin County with nothing more than a plan on a napkin and a few energy drinks.
We aren't bigshot millionaires or venture capitalists.  We are average joes who love to play sports.  Although we're entirely self-funded (aka broke), we donate what we can to our community's parks and schools. 

<br><br>We have one goal here at Sportfast, and that's to bring recreational sports into
the 21st century.  Email lists.  Sporatic, inconsistent pickup games.  These are issues every athlete has dealt with at some point.  All it would 
take is a little elbow grease and a lot of coding, and we could have ourselves an awesome tool.  And that's how Sportfast was born.  

<br><br>We're entirely dedicated to both our users and our cause.  Our users' input is incredibly valuable to us, so if you have ANY suggestions (seriously, anything) we would love 
to hear from you.   We take all suggestions seriously and enjoy hearing what features our users want.

<br><br>Above all else, we just want to thank you for your support and participation.
