##Description
Sportfast.com is a platform designed to simplify the way recreational sports are organized.  Users can find, manage, or communicate with their pickup games and league teams as well as track their own stats and the activity of other players in their area.  The system takes much of the primitive nature of recreational sports (email lists, needless texts) and replaces it with a streamlined automated system.

The site is currently in beta: <a href='http://www.sportfast.com'>www.sportfast.com</a>

Note: In the interest of security, most of the code used on the live site is excluded from this repository.
